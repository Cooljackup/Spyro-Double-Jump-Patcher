This program was made after figuring out how to restore Double Jump back into **Spyro: Year of the Dragon**, from **Spyro: Ripto's Rage**. This patcher was made to help simplify the process of patching Double Jump back into the game.

### Games that are supported:
* Spyro - Year of the Dragon v1.0 NTSC
* Spyro - Year of the Dragon v1.1 NTSC
* Spyro - Year of the Dragon v1.0 PAL
* Spyro - Year of the Dragon v1.1 PAL

***PLEASE NOTE:*** Any earlier builds of **Spyro - Year of the Dragon** I cannot confirm whether or not they will work with this program! Please make a backup if you attempt to use this program with them!

### How to use this program:
To use this program, drag and drop any **Spyro: Year of the Dragon** ROM onto the .EXE! Thats it. Its that simple.
The program will constantly warn you and get you to press *ENTER* everytime using the program, just so you're aware of the consequences.. Speaking of consequences...

***A FAIR WARNING AGAIN:***
I *will* and **ALWAYS** recommend making a backup of your ROM, just in case if this program does make a mistake for whatever reason!
**You have been warned...**

### One *MAJOR* Issue... 
This can and will trigger the Anti-Piracy in the game, I have no idea what causes it, and why it happens, but as of right now, it does trigger, and we cannot do much about it. **We are trying to resolve this as quick as possible, and make this patch 100% and not trigger Anti-Piracy.** My current recommendation is trying to use a a cheat/another patch to resolve the Anti-Piracy, until I have it built into the patcher.
