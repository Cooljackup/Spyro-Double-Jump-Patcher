# Spyro-Double-Jump-Patcher
[![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Cooljackup/Spyro-YotD-Double-Jump-Patcher/total)](https://github.com/Cooljackup/Spyro-YotD-Double-Jump-Patcher/releases) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/619694339777495056?color=7289DA&label=Mod%20the%20Dragon&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff)](https://discord.gg/nVwGhN2)

A tool that was created from a decade old question that has been lurking around until this day that if the Double Jump glitch that originated from **Spyro: Ripto's Rage** was ever possible in the other classic Spyro games. This simple patcher tool was made to help simplify the process of patching and unpatching the Double Jump glitch into any of the games at any time.

***Note:*** As of right now, only **Spyro: Year of the Dragon** final releases are supported. I plan on adding the other games as well as maybe some earlier builds of the games in here once I get around to it. Until then, any earlier builds of **Spyro: Year of the Dragon** ***(This includes demos and prototypes!)*** I cannot confirm whether or not they will work with this program! Please make a backup of them if you attempt to use this program with them!

## Program Usage:
To use this program, open it and it will show you a command line, showing the program and some details about it. Next you'll want to press ENTER when it prompts you. A Windows Explorer tab will open, letting you from there select the Spyro ROM you wish to patch. Once selected, the program will automatically detect which Spyro ROM you have put in to use, and will tell you if it is patched already or not. It will prompt you again to press ENTER to confirm you want to add or remove the Double Jump glitch.
Everytime this program is opened, it will always tell you what to do, as well as warn you of the consequences that can happen! While I'm on the topic of consequences...

***A FAIR WARNING AGAIN:***
**I WILL and ALWAYS WILL recommend you to make a backup of your Spyro ROM, NO MATTER THE CASE, EVEN IF ITS A FINAL BUILD OF THE GAME!** You never know what could happen. I do not wish to be the one responsible if something does happen!
***You have been warned...***

### One *MAJOR* Issue... (For Now...)
In Spyro: Year of the Dragon, this can and will trigger the Anti-Piracy! I have no idea what truly causes it and why it happens, but as of right now, I can not do much about it without completely dissecting the entire game. I have tried resolving it but ends up not resolving the issue, so until then I recommend trying to use a cheat or another type of patch that resolves the Anti-Piracy, until I have been able to determine how to fix it myself and have a tool for it.

## Compiling and Usage:
This project was built and compiled with [Beef](https://github.com/beefytech/Beef), a open source IDE workspace.
Beef IDE is used to compile programs, using the language known as *beeflang*.

In order to compile this program, all you need is the Beef IDE workspace which you can download [here](https://www.beeflang.org/), as it should compile out of the box with no issues regardless of what build of Beef you're on.
