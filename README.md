[![GitHub All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/Cooljackup/Spyro-YotD-Double-Jump-Patcher/total)](https://github.com/Cooljackup/Spyro-YotD-Double-Jump-Patcher/releases) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/619694339777495056?color=7289DA&label=Mod%20the%20Dragon&logo=discord&logoColor=ffffff)](https://discord.gg/nVwGhN2)

This program was made after figuring out how to restore Double Jump back into **Spyro: Year of the Dragon**, from **Spyro: Ripto's Rage**. This patcher was made to help simplify the process of patching and unpatching Double Jump into the game at any time.

### Games that are supported:
* Spyro: Year of the Dragon (v1.0 NTSC-U)

***PLEASE NOTE:*** Any earlier builds of **Spyro: Year of the Dragon (This includes demos, and prototypes!)** I cannot confirm whether or not they will work with this program! Please make a backup of them if you attempt to use this program with them!

### How to use this program:
To use this program, drag and drop any **Spyro: Year of the Dragon** ROM onto the .EXE! Thats it. Its that simple.
Everytime this program is used, it will always remind you how to use the program and warn you of the possibilities/consequences that can happen! Just so you're aware of what you're doing... While we're on the topic of consequences...

***A FAIR WARNING AGAIN:***
I *will* and **ALWAYS** recommend making a backup of your ROM, **NO MATTER EVEN IF ITS A FINAL BUILD OF THE GAME!** Just in case if this program does make a mistake for whatever reason! I do not wish to be responsible for if something does happen!
**You have been warned...**

---
### One *MAJOR* Issue... (For Now...)
This can and will trigger the Anti-Piracy in the game, I have no idea what causes it, and why it happens, but as of right now, it does trigger, and we cannot do much about it. **We are trying to resolve this as quickly as possible, and make this patch 100% and not trigger Anti-Piracy.** My current recommendation is trying to use a a cheat/another patch to resolve the Anti-Piracy, until I have it built into the patcher.
